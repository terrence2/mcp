Open_House
===

OpenHouse is:
* Secure/Privacy -- no broadcasting your every movement across the internet to
  hundreds of servers you don't control.
* Easy -- IoT interations are represented in Yggdrasil, a dataflow language
  that makes orchestrating complex interactions trivial.
* Fast -- OpenHouse is 100% Rust. Switching on lights should take
  nanoseconds, not milliseconds.
